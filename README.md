# Get-Er-Done

This website was made as a part of the Javascript section of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) curriculum. Get-Er-Done is built from the ground up using vanilla Javascript and the newer ES6 module system. Personal task data is saved via local storage in the individual's browser. Get-Er-Done draws a lot of inspiration from the amazing [Todoist](https://todoist.com/).

## Learning Objectives

- Create a full featured, reactive to do app while only utilizing the tools afforded to me by vanilla Javascript.
- Write much more function based code, become more familliar with importing and exporting data from modules.
- Use [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com/) to help parse datetime data and to easily compare dates.
- Push my CSS skills in both responsive design as well as overall aesthetic.
- Use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to partition stylesheets based on components
- Improve on my understanding and execution of responsive design principles.
- Make my code more modular and partitioned overall

## Why Vanilla Javascript?

Get-Er-Done was started before I had learned about any front-end frameworks but was revisted, and vastly improved on once I had used several front-end frameworks. While the general logic, rendering / conditional rendering would have been easier to impliment using a framework, this project has vastly improved my understanding and abilities with vanilla Javascript.
